# New England FGC Website

The New England Fighting Game Community is pretty large and separated.  The amount of times I get asked something like "yo is there an SF6 weekly in Boston?" has finally gotten to me, so I decided to make this website with [JustVine](https://twitter.com/JustVineNews), as the amount of new players that say they couldn't find any information about the scene is way more than it should be.  So this website is an attempt to help consolidate information to make it easier for people to find the events and players near them.

If you think something should be added to the site, get in contact with me here or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/OmniRarab).
